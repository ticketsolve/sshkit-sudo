# SSHKit::Sudo (Ticketsolve fork)

This is the Ticketsolve fork of the sshkit-sudo gem.

The difference with the original is that due to simplified assumptions in our infrastructure, the logic can be simplified; since implementing the sudo functionality can be confusing if one is not familiar with Capistrano, we've decided to prioritize simplicity over functionality.

For the reasons above, this gem is likely useless outside of our infrastructure.
